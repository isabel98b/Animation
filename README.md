Animation
=============

In this project you will write a program with an animation. The animation is created by drawing the same shape or shapes over and over again. Each time the shape is drawn, some aspect will change. In the sample code in Animation.pde, it's the radius of the ellipse that changes every time the screen is drawn. You may use any drawing function that you would like, your animation does not have to look like the sample.   

Your program will need variables for each aspect of the shape that changes. Optional: You might try putting `smooth()` in `setup()` and adding a little opacity in `draw()`. The combination can achieve some surprising results
